# NeatResearch

Update to Seth Bling's Mar I/O lua code.  

Added a start/stop button so that the algorithm doesn't auto-start on load and so that one can easily pause the algorithm.

For some reason, the load feature did not work on my machine.  This is now fixed so that I can load a previously saved pool.

Moved the neat graphics to the form window instead of as a gui overlay.  I liked the gui overlay but I prefer to to separate the game window from the neat information.

Did some miscellaneous house-keeping, like moving global config settings into their own file, etc.
